# Soulflame Horn Buff
Shows when you have the soulflame horn buff (entice) on you.

Doesn't currently flag the buff as used if you attack in defensive stance.

Plays a sound (tuturu from stein's gate) when the horn spec is used, or when you recieve the entice buff. This is optional and can be turned off.
Then an overlay will pop up with the number of game ticks you have to use the buff.
